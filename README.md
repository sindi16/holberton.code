Welcome to the **HolbertonCode** repository! This repository contains code and projects developed during my time at Holberton School.

## Key Elements of Writing READMEs in Markdown

### Basic Markdown Commands

Here are some basic Markdown commands to help you format your README effectively:

### 1. Headings
You can create headings by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the heading level (from 1 to 6).

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

### 2. Bullet Points
To create bullet points, use `*`, `+`, or `-` followed by a space.

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Sub-item 2.1
  * Sub-item 2.2
- Item 3
```

### 3. Numbered Lists
For numbered lists, simply use numbers followed by a period.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### 4. Links
You can create links using the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link Text](http://example.com)
```

Example:
```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com)
```

### 5. Images
To add images, use a similar syntax to links but start with an exclamation mark:

```markdown
![Alt Text](http://example.com/image.jpg)
```

Example:
```markdown
![Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)
```

### 6. Code
For inline code, wrap the text in backticks:

```markdown
Here is some `inline code`.
```

For code blocks, use triple backticks (```):

```markdown
```
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
```
